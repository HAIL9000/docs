# Style Guide (aka *✨the brand✨*)

Because Django Girls PDX is all about creating a space where women and non-binary folks feel comfortable exploring programming, it's pretty important that we present ourselves in a way that helps build that atmosphere. Also, because we rely on many people and businesses in the community to keep making our workshop work, it's important to present ourselves in a way that's consistent and professional so people will continue to work with us.

### The Vague Stuff

Django Girls is about creating a space that is fun and welcoming. We want people to know that programming is for everyone and that it can be fun. We should always try to convey this message in our outward facing work. Always shoot to be fun, positive, kind, and welcoming. Try the best you can to be grateful and eager to help. And don't forget to be genuine! Django Girls is about building community, we want people to know that we're real people, we don't want to seem fake or insincere.

These are the core tenants of Django Girls PDX we agreed to in the organizer pledge:

- Being inclusive
- Integrity, not having conflicts of interest
- Holding events that emphasize fun, building community, and learning, in that order
- Celebrating women and non-binary people

The way we present ourselves should always align with these goals. Additionally, we should be sensitive of the fact that many people from different walks of life come to Django Girls with different goals and aspirations. We are here to empower women and non-binary people to achieve their goals, whatever they might be. We should make sure we present Django Girls PDX in a way that's consistent with that fact. In short, there is no "right" Django Girls PDX attendee narrative and we should never make someone feel like that's the case.

### Some More Specific Instructions

- Inclusive imagery and language. For example, if you're using emojis of people, include people of color. Don't forget to include non-binary people when you talk about who the workshop is for.
- Make sure your tweets and posts are well proofread. Try to avoid typos, misspellings, confusing wording, etc. It's pretty imperative that we come off as professional (but still fun).
- Double check any information you're tweeting about (like dates)!! The last thing we want is incorrect information floating around confusing people.
- If you're tweeting photos, try to make sure they're reasonably high quality and look alright. Again, we gotta look professional!
- Use minimal hashtags or none at all. They tend to make tweets seem impersonal and a little fake. Plus they don't provide us with much visibility. If you want to use a #djangogirls or something specifically  relevant go for it, but no more than one or two hash tags per tweet. When in doubt, skip them.
- Try to tag relevant parties when you can, (e.g. if you're talking about PyLadies use @PyLadies_pdx). We want to help provide visibility to the organizations and people in the community we're working with.
- Try not to spam people. Make sure we don't tweet too often and too close together. TweetDeck let's you schedule tweets so if you want to queue them up and be done with it that's a good way to go!
- Tweets and other social media posts should be fun and positive! In addition to the language of them there some techniques we use to help convey that tone:
  - gifs! We love gifs, especially things that align with the Django Girls "brand" (e.g. fun, cute etc.). Consider cute animal gifs, cartoons/anime, gifs featuring women etc. Try to be sensitive with your gif choice, make sure you don't pick something that may make someone feel left out or excluded.
  - emojis! Spice up any tweet with some good emojis. Use whatever ones you think are appropriate but here are a few we commonly use: ✨🌸💾🎉💻💖💕🎈💌🎊🍐🦄💝🌷
